        Hi everyone! I have to take a break from making swimsuits as I'm going
        off to college. Unfortunately, this means that you won't be able to
        order any new suits for a while. Depending on how life goes, I may open
        up the shop during the next couple summers, however I will be primarily
        focusing on my schoolwork during the rest of the year. If you want to be
        the first to know that we've reopened, please follow on Instagram or
        Facebook: @ehukaiswim.
      </p>

        Please contact me if you have any additional questions. Thank you so
        much for your patience and understanding!!!
